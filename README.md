Finder Apps
======================

Finder Apps are applications for the Mac OS X Finder. They allow quick access to repetitive tasks.

## Terminal Here:
   Opens a Terminal and changes the current directory to the Finder window.

## MateDot:
   Opens the current directory in TextMate.

## Touch:
   Creates a new file (touches a file, in UNIX terminology) in the current directory.

Installation
------------
1. Move the relevant application (.app file) to your /Applications directory.
2. Then drag the application (from the /Applications directory, not from the disk image) to the
   toolbar of a Finder window (the space between the icons on the left and the search box on the
   right) and wait for one or two seconds.

The icon of the app sticks to the Finder, and you can click it to access its features.
